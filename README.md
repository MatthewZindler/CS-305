SNHU Software Security

* Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artimis Financial is a global financial consulting company, seeking modern security for their business and customers. They need help setting up encryption, addressing vulnerabilities in code, and using up to date secure coding practices and programs to keep their data safe. They need these features to provide the best service for their customers, and to make global business possible.

* What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

The most important vulnerability in their system in the lack of encryption services. Encryption is essential for global operations to keep their client's information private and safe from prying eyes. Adding an encryption service and also using secure coding practices ensures minimal errors and potential security breaches. Having up to date software security gives them and their customers peace of mind that their information is safe.

* What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The most challenging aspect of working through vulnerabilities was knowing what issues were important in dependency checks. Knowing which errors to overlook where there is no solution, versus knowing when to update different versions, or even doing some strange workaround offered by other sources was a hard challenge for me.

* How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

Increasing layers of security is the best way to defend against attacks, through the course we added CAs, checked dependencies for holes, and added encryption. In the future, I can see myself using dependency checks a ton to assess vulnerabilities, as well and using encryption to protect sensitive data.

* How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Dependency checks come in again at this step, to check for any vulnerabilities introduced after changes occurr. The code was also tested for encryption and decryption to ensure that each string was being converted into a random string, and decrypted without data loss. much of this involved continuous testing and updates to the code I had wrote, and checks for newer vulnerabilities.

* What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Online assistance from sources like stackexchange are great sources for fixing errors in code (but still needs to be checked for security issues). The most important practice that I have employed and will continue to use is clean coding. Clean code allows me to easily reread what I have written, and can show early vulnerabilities. It also reduces technical debt and allows others to more easily view and change my code.

* Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would showcase the skills that I am starting to aqcuire, namely encryption and software vulnerability tracking. Using static testing tools like dependency checks will become common place to find vulnerabilities in my code that I wouldn't be able to tell myself. Knowing what is wrong and what I need to do to fix it, from updating third party applications to integrating workarounds to vulnerabilities is something that I want to continue doing. Encryption is another important aspect of software security that I would wish to showcase. Being able to hide information is essential to security, and developing this skill is something that I would like to be able to show off.
